## 2026-06-14 — gen1: first intent (greetings & farewells)

**Changed:** `brain.c` → `gen1-greet`.
- Added `normalize()` (lowercase + trim) and `matches_any()` so intent
  matching ignores case and stray spaces.
- Greetings (`hello`/`hi`/`hey`) → "Hi there!", farewells (`bye`/`goodbye`)
  → "Goodbye!". Everything else still falls back to the gen0 parrot echo.
- New `tests/cases/greet.chat` locks in the behaviour (incl. case-insensitive
  + spaces + no-regression echo). Updated `parrot.chat` to test the echo
  *fallback* with non-intent inputs, since "hello" is now an intent.

**Why:** Smallest honest step off pure echo, and a full end-to-end lap of the
loop (TASK → brain.c → tests → journal) to validate the mechanism before we
make the brain articulable.

**Observed:** `make test` green (2 cases); `make chat` greets and bids
farewell, parrots the rest.

**Next:** See `TASK.md` — give the brain the *capacity to articulate* into
cooperating sub-systems (a module registry), per PRINCIPLES.md's corollary.
This is infrastructure for emergence, not a design of the modules themselves.

## 2026-06-14 — gen0: bootstrap, the parrot

**Changed:** Created the experiment scaffold.
- `src/main.c`: stable I/O shell — line-based REPL, one stdout response per
  input line, decorative prompts on stderr, `/quit` to exit.
- `src/brain.c` + `brain.h`: the evolving "brain". gen0 (`gen0-parrot`) just
  echoes input verbatim — the most honest zero-agent.
- `Makefile`: `make`, `make chat`, `make test`, `make loop`, `make clean`.
- `tests/run.sh` + `tests/cases/parrot.chat`: conversation test harness using
  a `>` input / `<` expected-response line protocol.
- `LOOP.md`: the self-improvement protocol.

**Why:** Establish the smallest thing that runs, can be talked to (`make
chat`), and can be tested — so every later generation is a small, verified
step on top.

**Observed:** Echo works; tests green.

**Next:** See `TASK.md` — gen1: recognise greetings/farewells instead of
parroting them.
